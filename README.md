# Project Overview:
Title: Padma Bridge Automated Toll Software
Background:
Traffic congestion is a significant issue in Bangladesh, often exacerbated by manual toll collection systems at bridges and highways. The Padma Bridge, a pivotal project aimed at improving transportation efficiency, still employs a manual tolling system, leading to traffic jams and delays. To address this, we developed the Padma Bridge Automated Toll Software, which aims to automate toll collection, thereby reducing congestion and improving travel times.

# Problem Scenario:

Traffic congestion due to manual toll collection.
Time-consuming toll processing leading to delays.
Inefficient management of toll collections.
Objectives:

Reduce traffic congestion at toll points.
Minimize time wastage during toll collection.
Enable direct transactions between the vehicle owner’s bank account and the toll system.
Enhance the overall efficiency and convenience of travel across the Padma Bridge.
Solution:
The Padma Bridge Automated Toll Software leverages blockchain technology and cloud storage to provide a secure, efficient, and automated toll collection system. Vehicles will be identified via sensors and QR codes, and the toll amount will be directly deducted from the owner's bank account without the need to stop at the toll center.

Key Features:
Automated Vehicle Detection: Vehicles are detected using sensors and QR codes, allowing for seamless toll collection without stopping.
Direct Bank Transactions: The toll amount is automatically deducted from the vehicle owner's bank account.
Real-time Notifications: Owners receive notifications of deductions via SMS, ensuring transparency.
Secure Transactions: Blockchain technology ensures secure and tamper-proof transactions.
Cloud Storage: All transaction data is securely stored in the cloud, allowing for easy access and management.
Functional Requirements:
Login Functional Requirements:

Users can log in with a username and password.
Credentials are verified against database records.
Successful login redirects to the user’s home page.
Incorrect credentials trigger a verification code sent to the user’s email.
Transaction Processing:

Toll amounts are securely deducted from the bank account.
Transaction details are stored in the cloud.
Owners receive SMS notifications of transactions.
Vehicle Identification:

Vehicles are identified using QR codes and sensors.
New vehicles require QR codes on their number plates.
Technologies Used:
Blockchain: Ensures secure and decentralized transaction records.
Cloud Storage: Provides scalable and reliable data storage solutions.
Component-Based Development Model: Utilizes reusable components to enhance development efficiency and quality.
Project Lifecycle:
The project follows the Waterfall model, progressing through sequential phases of requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
